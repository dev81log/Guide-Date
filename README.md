# Guide Date

C# program that demonstrates various ways to work with dates and times in the `C#` programming language. It creates a new DateTime object with a specific date and time and shows how to access the year, month, day and day of the week. Then, it uses the DateTime.Now property to get the current date and time and shows different ways to format it using String.Format. 

It then adds days, months and years to the current date and checks if the current date is equal to today's date. The code also uses the CultureInfo class to display the current date in different cultures and TimeZoneInfo to find the time zone for a specific location. It also uses the TimeSpan object to show time duration and check if the current day is a weekend day and check if it is daylight saving time.
